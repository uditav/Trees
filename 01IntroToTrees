Basic terms:
1. Root node
2. Sub-tree
3. Children
4. Leaf node
5. Ancestor

- Full Binary Tree: either 0 or 2 children

- Complete binary tree: All levels are completely filled except last level
                      Last node has all nodes on left as possible

- Perfect binary tree: All leaf nodes at the same level

- Balanced binary tree: height of tree can be at max log(N), where N is number of nodes

- Degenerate tree: they are skew trees ie. every node has a single child

To find the no of nodes at level i -> 2 ^ (i-1)
